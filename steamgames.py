A small API wrapper intended to retrieve all available store information
for either a specific appid, or all appids.

Thanks for this SteamDB.info blog post for the idea on the best way to do this:
http://steamdb.info/blog/5/

This should give you all of the same info that, say, SteamCalculator's script does
(https://github.com/spezifanta/SteamCalculator-Scripts), but it's much more efficient and
can return much more info.
